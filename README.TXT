This Project will be showing off DOM manipulation creating a project that works on
mouseover (hovering) where the squares will change color when the mouse passing over.

first i need to create a container to hold the the sketch pad so when the user clicks on the sketch pad,
the color of the square where the cursor is changes color (change background color). i would then create the 
sketch pad inside the container, the sketch pad must be able to be resized depending on what the user wants (limit of 100 squares).

i want the sketch pad to be made up of square divs with equal sizes. 

i want to create a button that will clear the sketch pad and give the user a clean work space. 

i want to create another button that will change to a mode that changes the color for the user.

i want to create the ability for the user to select the size of their sketch pad (change the size of the square divs inside of the container)
